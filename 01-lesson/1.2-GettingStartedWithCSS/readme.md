## Starting with some HTML

Our starting point is an HTML document. You can copy the code from below if you want to work on your own computer. Save the code below as index.html in a folder on your machine.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Getting started with CSS</title>
      </head>
    
      <body>
        <h1>I am a level one heading</h1>
    
        <p>
          This is a paragraph of text. In the text is a
          <span>span element</span> and also a
          <a href="https://example.com">link</a>.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          This is the second paragraph. It contains an <em>emphasized</em> element.
        </p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>Item <span>one</span></li>
          <li>Item two</li>
          <li>Item <em>three</em></li>
        </ul>
      </body>
    </html>

## Adding CSS to Our Document

>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across,   
> â€” linking CSS from the head of your document.
>* Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as `styles.css`. The `.css` extension shows that this is a CSS file.

> To link styles.css to index.html, add the following line somewhere inside the <head> of the HTML document:
>* `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />`    

> This `<link>` element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the `rel` attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the value of the `href` attribute. 

You can test that the CSS works by adding a rule to styles.css. Using your code editor, add the following to your CSS file:

    `h1 {
      color: red;
    }`
