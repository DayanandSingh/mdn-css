## Starting with some HTML

Our starting point is an HTML document. You can copy the code from below if you want to work on your own computer. Save the code below as index.html in a folder on your machine.

    >> <!DOCTYPE html>
    >> <html lang="en">
    >>   <head>
    >>     <meta charset="utf-8" />
    >>     <title>Getting started with CSS</title>
    >>   </head>
    >> 
    >>   <body>
    >>     <h1>I am a level one heading</h1>
    >> 
    >>     <p>
    >>       This is a paragraph of text. In the text is a
    >>       <span>span element</span> and also a
    >>       <a href="https://example.com">link</a>.
    >>     </p>
    >> 
    >>     <p>
    >>       This is the second paragraph. It contains an <em>emphasized</em> element.
    >>     </p>
    >> 
    >>     <ul>
    >>       <li>Item <span>one</span></li>
    >>       <li>Item two</li>
    >>       <li>Item <em>three</em></li>
    >>     </ul>
    >>   </body>
    >> </html>
    >>
